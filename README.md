## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox

### What I learned

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```css
/*---gives the card view which enables to stay the same in mobile view---*/
  .card{
    background-color: #fff;
    border-radius: 10px;
    padding: 25px;
    max-width: 220px;
    width: 100%;
    margin :auto;
    opacity: 0.9;
    box-shadow: 4px 4px;
}
```



### Continued development

I plan to use this as a practise to build good product cards which can be widely used.
